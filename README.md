**Situation:** All 3rd year CPUT IT students were tasked with completing the Personality Assessment course, as part of the Project Presentation 3 module.

**Task:** My goal was to go through the course content and complete the related assesments by or before the due date.

**Action:** I took the time to go through the course content, and completed the related assesments in time.

**Result:** Initially I was a bit confused when it came to understanding and matching the correct personality types and careers. I learnt that my assumptions are not always right, and to thoroughly go through and grasp the content given.
